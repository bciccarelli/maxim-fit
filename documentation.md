Gemini 3 lets you combine Structured Outputs with built-in tools, including Grounding with Google Search, URL Context, Code Execution, and File Search.

Python
JavaScript
REST

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodToJsonSchema } from "zod-to-json-schema";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

const matchSchema = z.object({
  winner: z.string().describe("The name of the winner."),
  final_match_score: z.string().describe("The final score."),
  scorers: z.array(z.string()).describe("The name of the scorer.")
});

async function run() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-3-pro-preview",
    contents: "Search for all details for the latest Euro.",
    config: {
      tools: [
        { googleSearch: {} },

      ],
      responseMimeType: "application/json",

This example demonstrates how to extract structured data from text using basic JSON Schema types like object, array, string, and integer.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodToJsonSchema } from "zod-to-json-schema";

const ingredientSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().describe("Name of the ingredient."),
  quantity: z.string().describe("Quantity of the ingredient, including units."),
});

const recipeSchema = z.object({
  recipe_name: z.string().describe("The name of the recipe."),
  prep_time_minutes: z.number().optional().describe("Optional time in minutes to prepare the recipe."),
  ingredients: z.array(ingredientSchema),
  instructions: z.array(z.string()),
});

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

const prompt = `
Please extract the recipe from the following text.
The user wants to make delicious chocolate chip cookies.
They need 2 and 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda,
1 teaspoon of salt, 1 cup of unsalted butter (softened), 3/4 cup of granulated sugar,
3/4 cup of packed brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 2 large eggs.
For the best part, they'll need 2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips.
First, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Then, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour,
baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar
until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla and eggs, one at a time. Gradually beat in the dry
ingredients until just combined. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips. Drop by rounded tablespoons
onto ungreased baking sheets and bake for 9 to 11 minutes.
`;

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-3-flash-preview",
  contents: prompt,
  config: {
    responseMimeType: "application/json",
    responseJsonSchema: zodToJsonSchema(recipeSchema),
  },
});

const recipe = recipeSchema.parse(JSON.parse(response.text));
console.log(recipe);

JSON schema support

To generate a JSON object, set the response_mime_type in the generation configuration to application/json and provide a response_json_schema. The schema must be a valid JSON Schema that describes the desired output format.

The model will then generate a response that is a syntactically valid JSON string matching the provided schema. When using structured outputs, the model will produce outputs in the same order as the keys in the schema.

Gemini's structured output mode supports a subset of the JSON Schema specification.

The following values of type are supported:

string: For text.
number: For floating-point numbers.
integer: For whole numbers.
boolean: For true/false values.
object: For structured data with key-value pairs.
array: For lists of items.
null: To allow a property to be null, include "null" in the type array (e.g., {"type": ["string", "null"]}).
These descriptive properties help guide the model:

title: A short description of a property.
description: A longer and more detailed description of a property.
Type-specific properties

For object values:

properties: An object where each key is a property name and each value is a schema for that property.
required: An array of strings, listing which properties are mandatory.
additionalProperties: Controls whether properties not listed in properties are allowed. Can be a boolean or a schema.
For string values:

enum: Lists a specific set of possible strings for classification tasks.
format: Specifies a syntax for the string, such as date-time, date, time.
For number and integer values:

enum: Lists a specific set of possible numeric values.
minimum: The minimum inclusive value.
maximum: The maximum inclusive value.
For array values:

items: Defines the schema for all items in the array.
prefixItems: Defines a list of schemas for the first N items, allowing for tuple-like structures.
minItems: The minimum number of items in the array.
maxItems: The maximum number of items in the array.
